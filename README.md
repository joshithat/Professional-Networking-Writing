**Introduction**

The purpose of this C++ program is to provide a utility for converting numbers between the hexadecimal and decimal number systems. Hexadecimal and decimal are two commonly used number systems, and conversions between them are often required in various programming and engineering tasks.
The objectives of this program are as follows:

1.) To convert a hexadecimal number to its equivalent decimal representation.
2.) To convert a decimal number to its equivalent hexadecimal representation.
3.) To offer a user-friendly interface for performing these conversions interactively.
4.) To handle a range of valid input values, including both single characters and multi-digit

**Methodology**

The program has two functions: `hexToDec()` and `decToHex()`. The `hexToDec()` function takes a hexadecimal string as input and returns the equivalent decimal number. The `decToHex()` function takes a decimal number as input and returns the equivalent hexadecimal string.

The `hexToDec()` function works by first converting each hexadecimal digit to its decimal equivalent. Then, it multiplies each digit by the appropriate power of 16 and adds the results together. The following pseudocode shows the algorithm for the `hexToDec()` function:

```
def hexToDec(hexString):
  decimal = 0
  base = 16
  power = 0

  for i in range(len(hexString) - 1, -1, -1):
    digit = hexString[i]

    if digit >= '0' and digit <= '9':
      decimal += (digit - '0') * pow(base, power)
    elif digit >= 'A' and digit <= 'F':
      decimal += (digit - 'A' + 10) * pow(base, power)
    elif digit >= 'a' and digit <= 'f':
      decimal += (digit - 'a' + 10) * pow(base, power)

    power += 1

  return decimal
```

The `decToHex()` function works by repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 16 and taking the remainder. The remainder is then converted to a hexadecimal digit. The following pseudocode shows the algorithm for the `decToHex()` function:

```
def decToHex(decimal):
  hexString = ""

  while decimal > 0:
    remainder = decimal % 16

    if remainder < 10:
      hexString += str(remainder)
    else:
      hexString += chr('A' + remainder - 10)

    decimal //= 16

  return hexString[::-1]
```

The main function of the program simply prompts the user to enter a hexadecimal or decimal number, converts it to the other base, and prints the result.

**Results**

The following are some examples of the program's output:

```
Enter Hexadecimal number: F
The value of the decimal: 15

Enter the decimal number: 105
the value of the Hexadecimal: 69
```

**Conclusions**

This program effectively serves its intended purpose by providing a user-friendly interface for converting between hexadecimal and decimal number systems. It is precise, dependable, and adaptable, allowing for conversions of a wide range of values. Developers and engineers who commonly work with these number systems may find the application useful.

**Recommendations**

Implement error handling for erroneous input, such as non-hexadecimal characters in hexadecimal input or non-numeric characters in decimal input. This would make the software more robust.



Add input validation to guarantee that the user inputs legitimate options in the interactive menu (1, 2, or 0 to exit).



Include comments and documentation to make the code more intelligible and maintainable, particularly if it will be used by a team of developers.



Extensive testing of the program with a variety of input values to ensure its accuracy and reliability.



User-Friendly Enhancements: Consider including extra features such as offering conversion explanations or allowing the user to customize the conversions.
